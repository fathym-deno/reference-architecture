### High-Level Overview of the `$Tag` System

The `$Tag` system is a TypeScript utility designed to enhance type safety and flexibility by allowing developers to annotate and tag types with additional metadata. This system enables the creation of highly dynamic and reusable type definitions that can be used to enforce constraints, drive type inference, or manage complex type relationships in a scalable way.

#### Why Use the `$Tag` System?

1. **Enhanced Type Inference**: The `$Tag` system allows you to attach metadata to types, which can then be used to infer additional information during type checking. This is particularly useful in complex systems where types need to carry extra context that influences how they should be treated.

2. **Dynamic Type Annotation**: By using `$Tag`, you can dynamically add properties to existing types, effectively extending or modifying their behavior without altering the original type. This is beneficial in scenarios where you need to layer additional logic or constraints on top of a type.

3. **Modular Design**: The system's modularity allows you to separate concerns by attaching specific tags or metadata to types, making your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. Tags can be selectively stripped or extracted, allowing for flexible transformations of types as needed.

#### Key Components

1. **`$Tag`**: The core type that attaches a tag to a type. It allows you to annotate a type with a specific tag, identified by a `TType` string, and an associated value `TTag`.
   ```typescript
   export type $Tag<TType extends string, TTag> = {
     [K in `@${TType}`]?: TTag;
   };
   ```
