### High-Level Overview of the `$Tag` System

The `$Tag` system is a TypeScript utility designed to enhance type safety and flexibility by allowing developers to annotate and tag types with additional metadata. This system enables the creation of highly dynamic and reusable type definitions that can be used to enforce constraints, drive type inference, or manage complex type relationships in a scalable way.

#### Why Use the `$Tag` System?

1. **Enhanced Type Inference**: The `$Tag` system allows you to attach metadata to types, which can then be used to infer additional information during type checking. This is particularly useful in complex systems where types need to carry extra context that influences how they should be treated.

2. **Dynamic Type Annotation**: By using `$Tag`, you can dynamically add properties to existing types, effectively extending or modifying their behavior without altering the original type. This is beneficial in scenarios where you need to layer additional logic or constraints on top of a type.

3. **Modular Design**: The system's modularity allows you to separate concerns by attaching specific tags or metadata to types, making your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. Tags can be selectively stripped or extracted, allowing for flexible transformations of types as needed.

#### Key Components

1. **`$Tag`**: The core type that attaches a tag to a type. It allows you to annotate a type with a specific tag, identified by a `TType` string, and an associated value `TTag`.
   ```typescript
   export type $Tag<TType extends string, TTag> = {
       [K in `@${TType}`]?: TTag;
   };
   ```

2. **`$TagValues`**: Extends `$Tag` by allowing you to attach additional metadata values, identified by `TData` strings, to the tag. This is useful when the tag needs to carry multiple related pieces of data.
   ```typescript
   export type $TagValues<
       TType extends string,
       TTag,
       TData extends string = never,
       TValues extends Record<TData, any> = never,
   > = $Tag<TType, TTag> & {
       [Key in keyof TValues as `@${TType}-${Key & TData}`]?: TValues[Key];
   };
   ```

3. **`$TagExists`**: A utility type that checks whether a given type has a specific tag. It helps in conditional type logic by confirming the presence of a tag.
   ```typescript
   export type $TagExists<T, TType extends string, TTag = any> = T extends {
       [K in `@${TType}`]?: TTag;
   } ? true : false;
   ```

4. **`$TagStrip`**: Removes the tag and its associated metadata from a type. This is useful when you want to strip away the extra context after it has served its purpose.
   ```typescript
   export type $TagStrip<
       T,
       TType extends string,
       TTag = unknown,
       TData extends string = never,
       TExact extends boolean = false,
   > = false extends $TagExists<T, TType, TTag> ? T
       : [TData] extends [never] ? ExcludeKeysByPrefix<T, `@${TType}`>
       : ExcludeKeysByPrefix<T, `@${TType}-${TData}`>;
   ```

5. **`$TagExtractValue`**: Extracts the value associated with a specific piece of metadata from a tagged type. This is useful when you need to retrieve the value of a specific metadata key.
   ```typescript
   export type $TagExtractValue<
       T,
       TType extends string,
       TTag,
       TData extends string,
   > = T extends {
       [Key in `@${TType}-${TData}`]?: infer TValue;
   } ? TValue : never;
   ```

6. **`$TagDeepStrip`**: Recursively removes tags from a type tree. This is useful for deeply nested structures where you want to clean up all the tags from the entire type.
   ```typescript
   export type $TagDeepStrip<T, TType extends string, TTag = unknown> = $TagStrip<
       {
           [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends (infer U)[] ? $TagDeepStrip<U, TType, TTag>[]
               : T[K] extends object ? $TagDeepStrip<T[K], TType, TTag>
               : $TagStrip<T[K], TType, TTag>;
       },
       TType,
       TTag
   >;
   ```

#### Example Usage

```typescript
// Define a type with tags
type MyTaggedType = $TagValues<
    "Example",
    "Metadata",
    "key1" | "key2",
    { key1: "value1"; key2: "value2" }
>;

// Check if a type has a specific tag
type HasTag = $TagExists<MyTaggedType, "Example", "Metadata">; // true

// Extract a value from the tag
type ExtractedValue = $TagExtractValue<MyTaggedType, "Example", "Metadata", "key1">; // "value1"

// Strip tags from the type
type StrippedType = $TagStrip<MyTaggedType, "Example", "Metadata">;

// Recursively strip tags from a type tree
type DeepStrippedType = $TagDeepStrip<MyComplexType, "Example", "Metadata">;
```

#### Conclusion

The `$Tag` system provides a robust framework for managing and manipulating types in TypeScript with a high degree of flexibility. By allowing types to be annotated with metadata, it opens up possibilities for more dynamic type behaviors and complex type transformations, all while maintaining strong type safety.
