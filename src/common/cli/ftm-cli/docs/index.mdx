# Fathym CLI Framework

> **‚ÄúThe Fathym CLI is a declarative runtime compiler and scaffoldable CLI framework for modular command systems.‚Äù**

* **Declarative** ‚Üí driven by `.cli.json`
* **Compiler** ‚Üí statically builds distributable CLIs via `deno compile`
* **Scaffolder** ‚Üí templates, project initializers, code writers
* **Runtime** ‚Üí supports full command lifecycles (init, run, cleanup)
* **Config-as-Source** ‚Üí treats command structure, entrypoints, and tokens as runtime config

## What Is the Fathym CLI?

The Fathym CLI Framework is a **modular CLI platform** for building, running, compiling, and testing system-level commands ‚Äî all defined by configuration.

### Key Features

* Built in **Deno** ‚Äî no node\_modules or runtime dependencies
* Fully structured around `.cli.json` as its declarative root
* Every command is a module, every behavior is lifecycle-aware
* Uses an **IoC system** to inject services and wire runtime context
* Bundles into static binaries using `deno compile`
* Supports complete command simulation and testability via **CommandIntents**

It‚Äôs not a task runner. It‚Äôs not a CLI launcher. It‚Äôs a **composable system runtime**.

## Core Components

### `CLIConfig`

The `.cli.json` root config file. Defines CLI tokens, entrypoints, template paths, and command modules.

### `CLIDFSContextManager`

Manages and resolves scoped filesystems:

* `execution` ‚Üí default runtime dir
* `project` ‚Üí resolved via `.cli.json`
* `custom` ‚Üí passed via flags or services

### `IoCContainer`

Dependency injection system used to:

* Register services like `TemplateLocator`, `Scaffolder`, `Logger`
* Resolve and wire those services into each command

### `CommandRuntime`

Class-based authoring alternative to `Command(...)`, and the canonical output for fluent command declarations. Supports:

* Lifecycle hooks: `Init()`, `Run()`, `Cleanup()`
* Injected params, flags, and services
* Internal DSL resolution from fluent `Command(...)` definitions

### `CommandIntentRuntime`

Test runner for CLI commands, and the canonical output for fluent command intent declarations:

* Simulates a full run
* Validates output logs, exit codes, state changes
* Can execute compiled or source-based CLIs

## Why Use It?

| Feature                  | Fathym CLI                                 | Traditional Tools            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Declarative project root | `.cli.json`                                | hardcoded or CLI args        |
| DFS context aware        | execution, project, home, custom roots     | N/A                          |
| IoC lifecycle            | full dependency injection                  | usually hardcoded services   |
| Lifecycle phases         | `Init`, `Run`, `Cleanup`, `DryRun`, `Test` | often just `Run()`           |
| Static binary support    | `deno compile`                             | uncommon or OS-specific      |
| Intent-based test suite  | `CommandIntents` + output assertions       | mostly manual or shell-based |
| Scaffolding + runtime    | `TemplateScaffolder` + `CommandRuntime`    | usually separate concerns    |

This CLI was designed to **build other CLIs**. It is ideal for:

* System bootstrappers
* Framework generators
* Executable toolchains
* DevOps or DX infrastructure

## Supported Workflows

```txt
Author ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Compile ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Test
```

| Phase        | Description                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Author**   | Create commands using `Command(...)` or `CommandRuntime` classes     |
| **Scaffold** | Use `ftm init` or templates to generate structure                    |
| **Build**    | Embed templates + commands into `.build/` with `ftm build`           |
| **Compile**  | Generate binary CLI via `ftm compile`                                |
| **Run**      | Use `ftm run hello` or compiled binary with forwarded arguments      |
| **Test**     | Use `CommandIntentBuilder` to validate CLI behavior programmatically |

Each step can be used independently or chained in pipelines.

## Style & Structure Guidelines

* üéØ **Structured first, prose second** ‚Äî treat this like API docs + concepts
* ‚úÖ Emphasize terminology, lifecycle phases, and developer control
* üß± Prefer modular headings and examples over long explanation blocks
* üß™ Call out testability and system-building advantages
* üîß Keep tone dry, focused, internal-sounding ‚Äî like Rust, not React
